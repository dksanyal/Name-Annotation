# Name-Annotation
Automatic annotation of personal names
PubMed-01.csv is a CSV file each of whose rows is a pair <Name, Annotation>. The annotation assigns labels from the set {LN, FN, MN, SFX} (standing for Last Name, First Name, Middle Name, SuFfiX respectively) to each component of the name.
Annotations are generated using a rule-based system. Hence there might be occasional errors.
